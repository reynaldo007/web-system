            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">Himeji Castle (姫路城, Himeji-jō) is a hilltop Japanese castle complex situated in the city of Himeji which is located in the Hyōgo Prefecture of Japan. The castle is regarded as the finest surviving example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture, comprising a network of 83 rooms with advanced defensive systems from the feudal period.[</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">Fushimi Inari-taisha (伏見稲荷大社) is the head shrine of the kami Inari, located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. The shrine sits at the base of a mountain also named Inari which is 233 metres (764 ft) above sea level, and includes trails up the mountain to many smaller shrines which span 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) and take approximately 2 hours to walk up.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">The Philosopher's Walk is a pedestrian path that follows a cherry-tree-lined canal in Kyoto, between Ginkaku-ji and Nanzen-ji. The route is so-named because the influential 20th-century Japanese philosopher and Kyoto University professor Nishida Kitaro is thought to have used it for daily meditation.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">When completed in A.D. 80, the arena held 50,000 spectators who watched mythology-based dramas and reenactments of land and sea battles as well as executions, fights-to-the-death among gladiators, and the ghastly slaughter of wild animals. The underground pits where those gladiators awaited their demise were opened to visitors in 2010 along with the 110-foot-high upper ring of seats, which offer panoramic views of the Eternal City.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">One of the world’s largest sacred buildings and one of the holiest of Catholic sites, the basilica teems with ornate gold, marble columns, paintings of angels, iconic statues, and works created by a who’s who of Renaissance artists—including Raphael, Brunelleschi, Bernini, and Michelangelo, who sculpted the marble Pietà and designed the basilica’s massive dome.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">The social center of Rome for 1,200 years beginning in the fifth century B.C., this 700-yard-long piazza has been both marketplace and government center. The ruins of sacred temples’ columns and friezes (whether dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture, or to the emperors Vespasian and Titus) hint at the level of grandeur on display here two millennia ago.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the copper Statue of Liberty was a gift to the United States from the people of France. The female figure represents the Roman goddess Libertas and has become both a symbol of freedom and a way to welcome immigrants from abroad. The statue is located on Liberty Island in New York City. Due to safety reasons, public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been banned since 1916. A new Statue of Liberty Museum opened in 2019, featuring the original torch.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">This small island offshore from San Francisco is where notorious criminal Al Capone was imprisoned – in cell 181. Alcatraz served as a federal prison from 1934 to 1963. The Island has several landmarks, including the Warden’s House, Main Cellhouse and the Lighthouse, which was the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast. While the prison claimed that no prisoner escaped during its 29 years in operation, 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts. In 1946, six prisoners tried to escape and failed, leading to the Battle of Alcatraz.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-xs mb-3">It was originally known as “The Six Grandfathers”, and was renamed in 1885 after prominent New York lawyer Charles E Rushmore. The Mount Rushmore National Memorial is located in Keystone, South Dakota and features 60-foot (18m) sculptures of the heads of four US presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. Construction on the memorial began in 1927 and was completed in 1939. Each president was originally going to be depicted from head to waist, but lack of funds forced construction to end prior to completion.</p>
